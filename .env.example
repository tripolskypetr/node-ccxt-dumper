# Data Quality & Validation Parameters

# Minimum number of candles required to use median instead of average for reference price calculation
# Used in candle validation to detect incomplete/corrupted data
# If candles >= 20: uses median (more reliable statistics)
# If candles < 20: uses average (more stable for small datasets)
CC_GET_CANDLES_MIN_CANDLES_FOR_MEDIAN=20

# Factor to detect anomalously low prices (incomplete candles indicator)
# Minimum valid price = referencePrice / threshold_factor
# Example: if BTC reference price = 50,000 USD, minimum valid price = 50 USD
# Protects against corrupted exchange data and incomplete candles
CC_GET_CANDLES_PRICE_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD_FACTOR=1000

# Retry & Reliability Parameters

# Number of retry attempts when fetching candles from exchange fails
# Handles network issues, rate limits, and temporary exchange API problems
# After all retries fail, the last error is thrown
CC_GET_CANDLES_RETRY_COUNT=3

# Delay in milliseconds between retry attempts
# Prevents excessive load on exchange API during issues
# Gives exchange API time to recover from temporary failures
CC_GET_CANDLES_RETRY_DELAY_MS=5000

# Market Price Calculation

# Number of recent 1-minute candles used to calculate market price (VWAP)
# Used in ExchangeService.getMarketPrice() method
# Calculates Volume Weighted Average Price using typical price: (high + low + close) / 3 * volume
# If total volume is zero, returns simple average of close prices
CC_AVG_PRICE_CANDLES_COUNT=5
